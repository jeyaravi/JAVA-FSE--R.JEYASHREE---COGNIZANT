Exercise 10: Employee Management System - Hibernate-Specific Features
Business Scenario:
Leverage Hibernate-specific features to enhance your application's performance and capabilities.
Instructions:
1. Hibernate-Specific Annotations:
o Use Hibernate-specific annotations to customize entity mappings.
2. Configuring Hibernate Dialect and Properties:
o Configure Hibernate dialect and properties for optimal performance.
3. Batch Processing:
o Implement batch processing with Hibernate for bulk operations.

Program to code

Using to hibernate code settings to evolve a business strategy for the formation of the leverage input valid forms

package com.example.employeemanagementsystem.model;

import jakarta.persistence.*;
import lombok.Getter;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Setter;
import org.hibernate.annotations.BatchSize;
import org.hibernate.annotations.Cache;
import org.hibernate.annotations.CacheConcurrencyStrategy;

import java.util.List;

@Getter
@Setter
@NoArgsConstructor
@Entity
@Table(name = "departments")
@Cacheable
@Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_WRITE)
public class Department {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    @Column(nullable = false, unique = true)
    private String name;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department", cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
    @BatchSize(size = 10)
    private List<Employee> employees;

    @CreatedBy
    @Column(updatable = false)
    private String createdBy;

    @CreatedDate
    @Column(updatable = false)
    private LocalDateTime createdDate;

    @LastModifiedBy
    private String lastModifiedBy;

    @LastModifiedDate
    private LocalDateTime lastModifiedDate;
}
@ Dynamic Update
@Entity
@Table(name = "employees")
@DynamicUpdate
public class Employee {
    // Other fields and methods
}
This leads to the formation of the entity process of the business apllication sigma format specifier to evoleve as the process of the business apllicatuon process

Configure hibernate performance for the business strategy for the formation of the folder entity forms which always used to form in the business criteria applivcation process

leads to the formation of the hibernate formation criteria

@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
@JoinColumn(name = "department_id", nullable = false)
@Fetch(FetchMode.SELECT)
private Department department;

This leads to the formation of the business formation of the hibernate function criteria
THis leads to the completion of the business criteria application
this is the last question of the completion of the week 3 assesment.
